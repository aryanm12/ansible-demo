# Comprehensive Guide to Observability

## Overview
Observability comprises three essential pillars: Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing. This guide explores each component in detail, providing implementation strategies and best practices.

## 1. Infrastructure and Application Monitoring

### Core Metrics
- **Infrastructure Metrics**
  - CPU utilization patterns and thresholds
  - Memory consumption and allocation
  - Disk I/O and storage utilization
  - Network throughput and latency
  - Load averages and system performance

### Probable actions based on alerts from the metrices

#### Reactive Solutions
- Manual system checks and application restarts
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Resource reallocation

#### Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)
- Resource upgrade strategy
  - CPU enhancement (e.g., 4 vCPU to 16 vCPU)
  - Memory expansion (e.g., 32GB to 64GB RAM)

#### Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)
- Infrastructure expansion
  - Multiple server deployment
  - Load balancer configuration
  - Service discovery implementation

### Auto-scaling Framework
- Trigger Mechanisms
  - CPU utilization thresholds
  - Memory consumption patterns
  - Custom metric-based scaling

Tools: Nagios, Zabbix and many more

## 2. Centralized Logging Architecture

### Log Categories
- **System Logs**
  - Kernel events
  - Service states
  - Security events
  - Resource utilization

- **Application Logs**
  - Access patterns
  - Error tracking
  - Performance metrics
  - Business events
  - Audit trails

### Problem statement:
Infrastructure Scale:
- 5-10 compute instances
- Auto-scaling enabled environment
- 3 minimum persistent servers
- Multiple application tiers
Very difficult to view logs at a central place

Logging Solutions: Splunk Enterprise, Elastic Stack: ElasticSearch, Filebeat, Kibana

### Implementation Workflow
1. **Agent Configuration**
   - Installation
   - Log source identification
   - Destiation details

2. **Visualization Layer**
   - Dashboard creation
   - Alert configuration

## 3. Application Performance Monitoring (APM) and Distributed Tracing

### Tracing Components
- **Transaction Tracing**
  - End-to-end request tracking
  - Service dependency mapping
  - Latency analysis
  - Error tracking

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Response time monitoring
  - Throughput measurement
  - Resource utilization
  - Database performance

Tools: AppDynamics, New Relic
